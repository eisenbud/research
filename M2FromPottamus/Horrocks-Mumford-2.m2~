--Are there fibers of a generic projection to P3 that

--A priori, we need to test the regularity of the
--p-th power of the ideal generated by 4 random linear
--forms, where p is the y-regularity of the Rees algebra.
--We GUESS that p =10, the y-reg of the special fiber,
-- and there it's ok:

R = S/IX -- homog coord ring of X
L = ideal random(R^1, R^{4:-1})

--to check the guess, we try to compute the regularity of the Rees algebra,
--but this seems to be too hard: M2 spent 3 days and 2.5 GB of memory trying
--before I ran low on memory and killed the process.
