Given an inclusion of graded modules f: S--> M over a ring R,
the program outputs the smallest integer q
such that 
m^{n-q}(S\cap m^qM)=S\cap m^nM 
for all large n.
The idea is to form the ring R'=R[y,t]/(yt-x):t^\infty,
and to take the largest degree in y of a generator of
the kernel of M'-->>(M/S)', where 
X' denotes (R'\otimes X)/(t-torsion).
Note that we can actualy compute the same thing by setting
R'' = R[y,t]/(yt-x) and
X'= (R'' \otimes X)/(t-torsion). It's not clear which
is better!
