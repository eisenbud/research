Dear David,

I think we had a very good discussion yesterday. I am sorry I had to
leave. It seems that the problem is more complicated than we hoped. But I
think it's not hopeless. One of the issues is whether there are nilpotents
in the infinite jet scheme of a nodal curve. The calculations yesterday
appear to suggest that there are. However, there is something interesting
going on.

We start with the curve defined by the equation

y^2 = x^2 + x^3.

The next equation is

2 y y_1 = 2 x x_1 + 3 x^2 x_1.

Now if we take the square of the second equation, and substitute y^2 from
the first equation, we obtain:

x^2 (4y_1^2(1 + x) - (2x_1 + 3 x x_1)^2) = 0.

This suggests that

x (4y_1^2(1 + x) - (2x_1 + 3 x x_1)^2)

is a nilpotent element in ring of functions on the 1-jet scheme. Does it
survive in the limit? Well, the same equation also suggests that

x^2  and  (4y_1^2(1 + x) - (2x_1 + 3 x x_1)^2)

are divisors of 0 in the ring of function on the reduced part of the 1-jet
scheme (in other words, it is a divisor of 0 modulo the radical of the
ideal of the 1-jet scheme). But we know that in the limit there are no
divisors of 0 (if we take the radical of our ideal). This means that the
power of one of these divisors of 0 should become an element of the ideal
when we go to infinity. It is hard to believe that x^n could lie in the
ideal. But if it doesn't, then the power of the second does. Of course, it
could be a large power, but in any case it would be very interesting to
see what is going on. 

What do you think about this?

I think it would be good to meet again, perhaps, next week?

Best regards,       Ed
