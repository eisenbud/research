--problems: 
--1. Z_0 appears in one of the fractions, but the definition in terms
--of the original variables is not given; it must be "from" an intermediate
--stage of the computation.

--2. R was doubly graded, but T has been given a flat grading. This will make it
--impossible to use this routine to compute the integral closure of an ideal.
