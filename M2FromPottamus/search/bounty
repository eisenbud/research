-- Talking with David and Craig, Oct 16, 2006 Banff

-- Search for examples of ideals with high regularity in small numbers of variables
e.g. in 3 variables, find examples of ideals with regularity roughly d^3, d = maxgen(I),
or even d^2.

-- Projective dimension of 3 forms of degree d, small d.

-- Multiplicities
if R = S/I is not CM, try to find counterexamples of
  deg I <= 1/c! M1 ... Mc

or (f1, ..., fd are general linear forms, d + cod I = numvars)
counterexamples to
  deg(I,f1,f2,...,fd) <= 1/c! m1 m2 ... mc

-- powers of a linearly presented ideal
-- conj: If I is generated in degress d, and primary in n variables ,
--  and linear for p = ceiling((n-1)/k) steps,
--  then I^k = power of the max ideal.
-- So: take random ideals, truncate to get p steps linear, don't forget primary,
-- and then the check the result.

-- find a counterexample of strong lefschetz
-- 3 forms in 3 variables
-- reg(I,f^d)

-- or check weak lefschetz in 4 variables
