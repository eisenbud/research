-- If q: C -> Pn is the structure map of the cone, with relative dimension rD,
-- then the Segre classes are
-- s^i(C) = q_*(c_1(OO_C(1))^(i+rD)\cap [C]).

-- The idea is to first twist the cone by a sufficiently positive line bundle so O(1) is generated
-- by global sections, and then to push forward intersections of more and more general sections.
-- The pushforward of a given class is computed by restricting to a general plane section of the
-- image variety, and then computing the dimension of the module of 
-- global sections of the sheaf represented by the 1-dimensional
-- module that is the pushforward of the structure sheaf of the fiber.
