In this directory you will find four folders:

1) programs.surfaces
2) scripts.fos
3) scripts.sp
4) an.explicit.example 

1) contains programs ( written by Wolfram Decker ) which compute
the equations and syzygies of all smooth nongeneral type surfaces 
in P4 known to us.

For smoothness, adjunction and other useful things see the scripts 
in 2) and 3) (written by Frank-Olaf Schreyer and Sorin Popescu resp.).

4) contains a commented version of our program for an Enriques surface
with degree 11 and sectional genus 10 ( written by Frank-Olaf Schreyer
and Wolfram Decker ). This is the contents of Appendix A of our preprint

    Decker, Ein, Schreyer: Construction of surfaces in P4, 1991.

Folders 1)-3) contain their own README files with more details
