This folder contains several useful scripts:

-sectional genus: computes the arithmetic sectional genus and allows to use
		  this value as input of other commands. The hilb command
                  lacks this feature.
 	          
-self intersection: computes the self intersection number of a Cartier
		    divisor on a smooth projective surface.

-adjunction1: computes the image of a surface in P4 under H+K and the number 
              of its exceptional lines, or rather the ideal of the 
              corresponding points in the image surface. The script
              is a version of the script by F.-O. Schreyer. It doesn't
	      assume that the surface has p_g=0.

-symm_omega: computes a morphism whose kernel is the j-th symmetric power
             of the cotangent bundle Omega^1 over the current ring.

-skew_symmzation: given a n x n matrix A, with n even, computes a 
                  skew-symmetric matrix B such that pfaff(B)=det(A).
